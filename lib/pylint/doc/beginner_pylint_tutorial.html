<div class="para">For a detailed description of Pylint, see <a class="" href="http://www.logilab.org/project/pylint">http://www.logilab.org/project/pylint</a>.</div>
<div class="sect1-title">
<a name="intro"></a>1. Intro</div>

<div class="para">Beginner to coding standards?  Pylint can be your guide to reveal what's really
going on behind the scenes and help you to become a more aware programmer.</div>
<div class="para">Sharing code is a rewarding endeavor.  Putting your code 'out there' can be
either an act of philanthropy, 'coming of age', or a basic extension of belief
in open source.  Whatever the motivation, your good intentions may not have the
desired outcome if people find your code hard to use or understand.  The Python
community has formalized some recommended programming styles to help everyone
write code in a common, agreed-upon style that makes the most sense for shared
code.  This style is captured in <a class="" href="http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/">PEP-8</a>.  Pylint can be a quick and easy way of
seeing if your code has captured the essence of PEP-8 and is therefore
'friendly' to other potential users.</div>
<div class="para">Perhaps you're not ready to share your code but you'd like to learn a bit more
about writing better code and don't know where to start.  Pylint can tell you
where you may have run astray and point you in the direction to figure out what
you have done and how to do better.</div>
<div class="para">This tutorial is all about approaching coding standards with little or no
knowledge of in-depth programming or the code standards themselves.  It's the
equivalent of skipping the manual and jumping right in.</div>
<div class="para">My command line prompt for these examples is:</div>

<div class="sect1-title">
<a name="getting-started"></a>2. Getting Started</div>

<div class="para">Running Pylint with no arguments will invoke the help dialogue and give you a
idea of the arguments available to you.  Do that now, i.e.:</div>
<div class="programlisting">
robertk01 Desktop$ pylint
...
a bunch of stuff
...
</div>
<div class="para">A couple of the options that we'll focus on here are:</div>
<div class="programlisting">
Master:
  --generate-rcfile=&lt;file&gt;
Commands:
  --help-msg=&lt;msg-id&gt;
Commands:
  --help-msg=&lt;msg-id&gt;
Message control:
  --disable=&lt;msg-ids&gt;
Reports:
  --files-output=&lt;y_or_n&gt;
  --reports=&lt;y_or_n&gt;
  --include-ids=&lt;y_or_n&gt;
  --output-format=&lt;format&gt;
</div>
<div class="para">Also pay attention to the last bit of help output.  This gives you a hint of what
Pylint is going to 'pick on':</div>
<div class="programlisting">
Output:
   Using the default text output, the message format is :
  MESSAGE_TYPE: LINE_NUM:[OBJECT:] MESSAGE
  There are 5 kind of message types :
  * (C) convention, for programming standard violation
  * (R) refactor, for bad code smell
  * (W) warning, for python specific problems
  * (E) error, for much probably bugs in the code
  * (F) fatal, if an error occurred which prevented pylint from doing
  further processing.
</div>
<div class="para">When Pylint is first run on a fresh piece of code, a common complaint is that it
is too 'noisy'.  The current default configuration is set to enforce all possible
warnings.  We'll use some of the options I noted above to make it suit your
preferences a bit better (and thus make it 'scream only when needed').</div>

</div>
<div class="para">Wow.  That's a lot of stuff.  The first part is the 'messages' section while the
second part is the 'report' section.  There are two points I want to tackle here.</div>
<div class="para">First point is that all the tables of statistics (i.e. the report) are a bit
overwhelming so I want to silence them.  To do that, I will use the "--reports=n" option.</div>
<div class="para">Second, previous experience taught me that the default output for the messages
needed a bit more info.  We can see the first line is:</div>
<div class="programlisting">
"C:  1: Missing docstring"
</div>
<div class="para">This basically means that line 1 violates a convention 'C'.  It's telling me I
really should have a docstring.  I agree, but what if I didn't fully understand
what rule I violated.  Knowing only that I violated a convention isn't much help
if I'm a newbie.  So let's turn on a bit more info by using the option
"--include-ids=y".</div>
<div class="tip">
<div class="tip-name">Astuce</div>
<div class="tip-body">
<div class="para">Many of Pylint's commonly used command line options have shortcuts.
for example, "--reports=n" can be abbreviated to "-r n", and "--include-ids=y"
can be abbreviated to "-i y". Pylint's man page lists all these shortcuts.</div>
</div>

<div class="para">Oooh.  I like that better.  Now I know that I violated the convention number
C0111 and now I can read up a bit more about that.  Let's go back to the
command line and try this:</div>
<div class="programlisting">
robertk01 Desktop$ pylint --help-msg=C0111
No config file found, using default configuration
:C0111: *Missing docstring*
  Used when a module, function, class or method has no docstring. Some special
  methods like __init__ doesn't necessary require a docstring. This message
  belongs to the basic checker.
</div>
<div class="para">Yeah, ok.  That one was a bit of a no-brainer but I have run into error messages
that left me with no clue about what went wrong, simply because I was unfamiliar
with the underlying mechanism of code theory.  One error that puzzled my newbie
mind was:</div>
<div class="programlisting">
:R0902: *Too many instance attributes (%s/%s)*
</div>

<div class="para">Now that we got some configuration stuff out of the way, let's see what we can
do with the remaining warnings.</div>
<div class="para">If we add a docstring to describe what the code is meant to do that will help.
I'm also going to be a bit cowboy and ignore the W0402 message because I like to
take risks in life.  A deprecation warning means that future versions of Python
may not support that code so my code may break in the future.  There are 5 C0103
messages that we will get to later.  Lastly, I violated the convention of using
spaces around an operator such as "=" so I'll fix that too.  To sum up, I'll add
a docstring to line 2, put spaces around the = sign on line 16 and use the
"--disable=W0402" to ignore the deprecation warning.</div>
<div class="para">Here's the updated code:</div>

</div>
<div class="para">Nice!  We're down to just the C0103 messages.</div>
<div class="para">There are fairly well defined conventions around naming things like instance
variables, functions, classes, etc.  The conventions focus on the use of
UPPERCASE and lowercase as well as the characters that separate multiple words
in the name.  This lends itself well to checking via a regular expression, thus
the "should match (([A-Z_][A-Z1-9_]*)|(__.*__))$".</div>
<div class="para">In this case Pylint is telling me that those variables appear to be constants
and should be all UPPERCASE.  This rule is in fact a naming convention that is
specific to the folks at Logilab who created Pylint.  That is the way they have
chosen to name those variables.  You too can create your own in-house naming
conventions but for the purpose of this tutorial, we want to stick to the PEP-8
standard.  In this case, the variables I declared should follow the convention
of all lowercase.  The appropriate rule would be something like:
"should match [a-z_][a-z0-9_]{2,30}$".  Notice the lowercase letters in the
regular expression (a-z versus A-Z).</div>
<div class="para">If we run that rule using a --const-rgx='[a-z_][a-z0-9_]{2,30}$' option, it
will now be quite quiet:</div>
<div class="programlisting">

</div>
<div class="para">Regular expressions can be quite a beast so take my word on this particular
example but go ahead and <a class="" href="http://docs.python.org/library/re.html">read up</a> on them if you want.</div>
<div class="tip">
<div class="tip-name">Astuce</div>
<div class="tip-body">
<div class="para">It would really be a pain in the butt to have to use all these options
on the command line all the time.  That's what the rc file is for.  We can
configure our Pylint to store our options for us so we don't have to declare
them on the command line.  Using the rc file is a nice way of formalizing your
rules and quickly sharing them with others. Invoking 'pylint
--generate-rcfile' will create a sample rcfile with all the options set and
explained in comments.</div>
